        <li>1 cup Arborio rice or Spanish paella rice</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth (or fish stock)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green peas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced tomatoes (canned or fresh)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon saffron threads (or turmeric for color)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>200g chicken thighs, boneless and cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>200g shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>200g mussels or clams, cleaned</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a paella pan or large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chicken pieces, season with salt and pepper, and brown them evenly. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, saut√© onions and bell peppers until softened. Add garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in rice, ensuring it's well-coated with the oil and vegetables. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in white wine, letting it simmer and reduce by half.</li>
        <li>Add diced tomatoes, saffron (or turmeric), smoked paprika, and red pepper flakes. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour in chicken broth and return the browned chicken to the pan. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add shrimp and mussels/clams, pushing them slightly into the rice mixture.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking without stirring (to achieve the desired crust at the bottom) for another 10-15 minutes, or until rice is cooked and has absorbed the liquid. Add green peas in the last 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Check the seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
